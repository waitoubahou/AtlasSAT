## Overview
The **AtlasSAT Souss Water Management Mission** is a CubeSat mission designed to provide high-resolution multispectral and thermal imaging data for precision agriculture in the Souss region of Morocco. The mission focuses on optimizing water usage, monitoring soil moisture, and improving irrigation efficiency.

## Mission Objectives
- Provide actionable data for farmers and agricultural cooperatives.
- Monitor crop health using NDVI maps.
- Detect water stress in crops using thermal imaging.
- Support sustainable water management in the Souss region.

## Key Features
- **Payloads**:
  - Multispectral Camera: 5 m resolution, RGB, NIR, Red-Edge bands.
  - Thermal Imaging Sensor: 50 m resolution, 8–14 µm range.
- **Orbit**: Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO) at 600 km altitude.
- **Revisit Time**: 3–4 days.
- **Design Life**: 3–5 years.

## Repository Structure
- **Mission-Design**: Mission profile, requirements, and diagrams.
- **Simulation**: GMAT and MATLAB scripts for mission analysis.
- **CAD**: (Limited) CAD models of the satellite.
- **Documentation**: Reports on thermal, vibration, and structural analysis.
- **Images**: Diagrams and renderings of the satellite.
